# Portfolio
Below are things I've worked on and things I'm currently working on. I'm a software engineer by trade, and a hobbyist game developer and modder.

## Starfield Mods
I actually began creating mods in Creation Engine for Starfield, and then later on doing my own mods for Skyrim and Fallout 4. As of writing this there's no Creation Kit for Starfield so a lot of these mods are limited to recolors of existing items in the game.

## In progress
### Neo-noir Quest Mod
This mod will be a multi-chapter storyline, where each chapter ends neatly but the B-plot will continue throughout the chapters. The story will follow a detective by the name of Nolan Cross who is investigating a series of crimes that may be linked to the disappearance of his husband.

The first chapter will have Nolan reluctantly getting into investigation work again. He's approached by Jimmy, a member of a local Neon band who is trying to find his bandmates who have disappeared. Nolan gave up detective work, but the description of the disappearing band is eerily similar to that of his husbands. The player will explore the past of both Jimmy and Nolan. They will find out why Nolan doesn't want to be a detective anymore, and how Jimmy has struggled with aurora.

It will feature:
- Terminus, a new bar in Neon. It will be a custom made interior with a mix of Starfield assets and custom assets.
- Fully voice acted
- Music composed specifically for the questline

Here's a *very* early look at Terminus rendered in Unreal Engine.

### Mod Template
Not a mod but may help you structure your mods as you work on them. It's meant to be used with Spriggit and BSArch. It contains scripts to pack/unpack your archives and ESPs into their loose files/YAML respectively, build for releases and snapshots etc.

I'll continue to update it as needs arise. You can find it here: [creation-mod-template](https://github.com/yak3d/creation-mod-template)
