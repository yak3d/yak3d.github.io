I've been working on something somewhat close to the vest, but given the amount of folks who are looking for some quest mods for Starfield I wanted to part the veil a little on what I'm working on! This will also keep me honest on actually delivering it.


At a high level, Terminus is a multi-chapter quest mod. It will feature:

* Terminus, a new bar in Neon with a custom made interior mixed with Starfield and custom assets
* Escape meatspace by cyberrunning and actually going into cyberspace
* Fully voice acted
* Music composed specifically for the questline

## What is Terminus?
End of the line. Well, in a manner of speaking at least. Terminus is the name of this story and it is also the name of the punk rock bar it starts in.

### Terminus the Story
The story will be multiple chapters, but each chapter will end completely while a B plot will continue on from chapter to chapter. You will join a former detective by the name of Myra Holt. She's retired, and has zero interest in picking up new cases.

The first chapter will have Holt reluctantly getting into detective work again. She's approached by Jimmy, a guitarist for a local Neon band who is trying to find his bandmates who have disappeared. Holt rebuffs Jimmy, claiming she is retired and no longer doing that type of work. That is until Jimmy mentions a single name and Holt recognizes it as the sole clue in the disappearance of her niece.

You will explore these two characters and the mystery of the bandmates. You'll find out more about Holt and her niece and Jimmy and his struggle with Aurora.


### Terminus the Bar
I wanted to give Neon some more nightlife. The Astral Lounge has your EDM club covered, Madam Sauvage's Place as the dive bar to get drunk and Euphorika to get zoned out in peace.

So, the one I thought missing was the grungey rock bar like Red Dirt or The Hammer from *Cyberpunk 2077*, Club Atlantis from *Cyberpunk 2020* or a seedy place to grab beers like the Chat from *Neuromancer*. That's the type of vibe I've been trying to capture with Terminus.

Terminus is owned and run by a Freestar Collective veteran who goes by Cordova. For him, Terminus *is* the end of the line. He views it as the thing he will do until he dies. You'll have to talk to him to learn more.
