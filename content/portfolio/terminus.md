# Terminus
This mod will be a multi-chapter storyline, where each chapter ends neatly but the B-plot will continue throughout the chapters. The story will follow a detective by the name of Nolan Cross who is investigating a series of crimes that may be linked to the disappearance of his husband.

The first chapter will have Nolan reluctantly getting into investigation work again. He's approached by Jimmy, a member of a local Neon band who is trying to find his bandmates who have disappeared. Nolan gave up detective work, but the description of the disappearing band is eerily similar to that of his husbands. The player will explore the past of both Jimmy and Nolan. They will find out why Nolan doesn't want to be a detective anymore, and how Jimmy has struggled with aurora.

It will feature:
- Terminus, a new bar in Neon. It will be a custom made interior with a mix of Starfield assets and custom assets.
- Fully voice acted
- Music composed specifically for the questline

Here's a *very* early look at Terminus rendered in Unreal Engine.
