The signal had been going for three days when Captain Reeves finally noticed the pattern.

Static. Then a pulse. Then a voice, fragmented and distant, speaking in a language that hadn't been spoken in two hundred years.

"Command, this is Explorer-7. We've... we've found something."

Reeves adjusted the frequency dial, her fingers trembling slightly. The rest of the station was dark. The war had ended two weeks ago, and everyone had either fled or... well. She'd chosen to stay. Someone had to monitor the old channels.

"Explorer-7, this is Earth Command. Authenticate your transponder."

The response came slower this time, like the transmitter was dying, struggling against some cosmic interference.

"Can't. Systems failing. Listen to me. The structures we found—they're not ruins. They're... sleeping. All of them. On every world we visited. We woke something. When we opened the first chamber—"

The transmission cut to static. Reeves leaned forward, adjusting dials with muscle memory built over thirty years.

"Explorer-7, repeat your last. What did you wake?"

Static. Then, barely audible, a sound that might have been laughter or might have been screaming. The signal was deteriorating, the bandwidth narrowing to a thin, desperate line.

"It's still here with us. In the walls. We can hear it singing and—Captain, you have to warn them. When the third sun rises over Meridian, when the shadow—"

The transmission died completely. Not the kind of fade that comes from distance, but the kind that comes from destruction. Reeves sat back in her chair, watching the instruments continue their futile search for a signal that would never come again.

Her hands moved across the console with the certainty of someone who knows exactly what needs to be done. She began recording a message. Not for Command—there was no Command anymore. Not for anyone who could help.

Just a witness statement. A log entry. A last transmission of her own.

"This is Captain Sarah Reeves, Earth Monitoring Station Epsilon. If anyone finds this, know that Explorer-7's final mission ended on the worlds of the Meridian system. Their last recorded words were a warning about structures older than our species and something that wakes when they're opened."

She paused, looking at the star charts on her screen. At the thousands of sleeping worlds humanity had barely begun to explore.

"If anyone ever reaches those worlds again, don't open the chambers. Some doors aren't meant to be unlocked."

She hit transmit, sending her message out into the void. Then she turned off all the lights except the one that monitored incoming signals.

Just in case something answered.

Above Earth, in the depths of space, something ancient stirred. It had been patient for millions of years. It could wait a little longer. But soon, it would speak. And someone, somewhere, would listen.

That was inevitable.
