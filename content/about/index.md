# Yak
A programmer by day who uses game development and modding as a creative outlet. While game development got me into programming, it wasn't until later in life that I got back to it.

I started with **Programming Role Playing Games with DirectX®** by Jim Adams when I was a kid. At nearly *a thousand* pages that proved to be a bit much but it got me hooked.

Since then, I've delved into the following things!

## Bethesda Game Modding
Growing up with games like Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim got me hooked on RPGs. Modding them reeled me back into game development.

Though it took until Starfield to release for me to really try it in earnest. Some example mods are:

* [CyberRunner Room - Neon Sky Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12594)
* [Lodge Shower](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11674)

I have some coming ideas for Starfield that I hope I can realize. One of those being [Terminus](./portfolio/terminus.md)!

## Blender & Substance
A very new interest of mine and one of the few art forms I find my brain can comprehend! I'd consider myself still a beginner though most of the assets for Terminus I made myself in Blender and Substance.

I picked up a course by [3D Tutor](https://3dtudor.gumroad.com/) called **Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash**. As of now it looks like the course was delisted but I strongly suggest their courses!

## Unreal Engine
In addition to learning Blender, Unreal Engine 5 has been a recent pickup. The **3D Tutor** courses do touch on Unreal Engine but I wanted a more game focused look.

For this, I picked up **Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course** by [Stephen Ulibarri (Druid Mechanics)](https://www.youtube.com/DruidMechanicsGameDevelopment). I'll post my experience with it when I complete it.
